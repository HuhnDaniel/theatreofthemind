Theatre of the Mind is a tool for DMs, GMs, and others who love table top roleplaying.  This tool is designed to make games easier to run, so you have more time to enjoy the gameplay, and spend less time setting up your playspace.  Currently includes an initiative tracker, with future plans for tracking hp, roll to hit systems, and automated calculations with single button clicks.
